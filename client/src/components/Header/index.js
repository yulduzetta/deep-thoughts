// With React Router, however, you can't simply use <a> elements.
// An element like <a href="/login"> would cause the browser to refresh and make a new request to your server for /login.
// That would defeat the whole purpose of React and its single-page goodness.
// Instead, you can use React Router's Link component.
// This component will change the URL while staying on the same page.
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
